# Simple Pull Request Checklist

Use this checklist to review pull requests before merging.  
Tick each box as you go!

## ☐ Clear Description
- Does the pull request explain **what was changed** and **why**?
- Is the title clear and relevant?  
  _Example: “Updated project schedule table”_

## ☐ Relevant Files Only
- Are only the necessary files changed?  
  (Check no unrelated changes/snippets are included.)

## ☐ Formatting and Content
- Are the documents or files cleanly edited with no accidental deletions, typos, or formatting errors?
- Is it clear what sections or content were changed/added?

## ☐ No Hardcoded Passwords or Personal Data
- **Never add passwords, credentials, or personal/sensitive information (such as home addresses, private emails, or phone numbers) directly into files.**
- If credentials are needed, ask the maintainer for the recommended secure approach (e.g., environment variables, secure documents).

## ☐ Does It Make Sense?
- Do the changes make sense for the project, and are they easy to understand?
- If it's a document, is the information complete and consistent?

## ☐ No Conflicts
- Does GitHub show “Able to merge” with no conflicts?  
  (If there are conflicts, get help resolving them.)

## ☐ Review Feedback Addressed
- If any comments were made by reviewers, have all questions or concerns been addressed?

## ☐ Ready to Merge
- Is everyone who needs to review aware or mentioned with `@username` if required?
